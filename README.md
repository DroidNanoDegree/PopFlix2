Hello there,

The project in this folder contains the implementation for *Stage 2: Popular Movies* project part of the [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

As per the requirement for the project, the following items will be added to the app you built in [Stage 1](https://droidnanodegree.github.io/PopFlix/):

1. Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
2. Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
3. Also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
4. Create a database and content provider to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).
5. Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.

**NOTE:**
In order to successfully build and run the project the API key for [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org) needs to be set. Follow the steps below to set up the `tmdb_api_key`:
1. Create a file named *keys.properties*
2. Make an entry `tmdb_api_key=ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
3. Profit!
